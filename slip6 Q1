In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after 
processing of natural language data (text). Though "stop words" usually 
refers to the most common words in a language, there is no single universal 
list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools, and 
indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools specifically avoid 
removing these stop words to support phrase search.
